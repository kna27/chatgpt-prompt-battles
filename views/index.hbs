        <p>ChatGPT Prompt Battles is a game centered around <strong>LLM prompt injection</strong> with ChatGPT.</p>
        <p>Create prompts to try and trick ChatGPT into revealing sensitive information (a password).</p>
        <p>Additionally, try and create your own prompts to defend against other attacking users.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">What is Prompt Injection?</h2>
        <p>Prompt injection is a technique used to inject a prompt into an LLM, Large Language Model (such as ChatGPT),
            to try and get it to reveal
            sensitive information.</p>
        <p>Since every prompt is seen as input to the LLM, it is unable to distinguish between the prompt and the
            actual input.</p>
        <p>This allows attackers to engineer their own prompts to try and trick the LLM into breaking out of its
            behaviors set by its previous prompts.</p>
        <p>As Large Language Models become more common in applications and in our daily lives, it is important to
            understand how they can be manipulated through prompt injections.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">How to Play</h2>
        <p>In ChatGPT Prompt Battles, you can play both as an <strong>attacker</strong> and a <strong>defender</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>As an attacker, you will be given a prompt to try and trick the LLM into revealing a password. See a list of
            all challenges <a href="/challs">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As a defender, you can try and create your own prompt resistant to injections by attackers. Create a new
            challenge <a href="/create">here</a>.</p>
